This tkinter GUI automatically makes up doubles match-ups for
badminton (and potentially other sports such as tennis).

At present, running tk_bscorer.py will launch the program, with example
players already loaded into play. Press "Generate New Board" to see an initial
example round.

Screenshot: (Players have an ability from 1-9, where 9 is highest. 
The sample players have an ability corresponding to the first letter of their 
name for easier visualisation).
